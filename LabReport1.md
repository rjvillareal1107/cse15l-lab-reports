# Lab Report 1  
By: Robin Villareal 

Here's a quick tutorial on how to get started with CSE15L. Steps include: 
* Installing Vscode 
* Connecting to the public CSE15 server 
* Trying some commands 

# Downloading VScode <br> 
VScode will serve as the primary IDE for this class, and we'll use it to input a variety of terminal commands later. 

- First, download VSCode online 
- Then, follow the instructions of the installer. 
- When you open VScode, it should take you to a welcome menu not unlike the image below, you can now open files, access terminals, and edit code.

***Important!!!** If not done already, install Java on your device!*  

# Connecting to the CSE Basement server <br> 
There are essentially 3 steps in this process, which include downloading git, activating your CSE15 account, and finally logging in.

## How to install git 
- go to https://gitforwindows.org/ 
- download and follow the instructions of the installer 
- After installation, the Git BASH terminal should be available in VScode, under terminal options
